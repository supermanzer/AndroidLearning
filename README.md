# Android Learning

These are the apps I am building as I work through the [Big Nerd Ranch book on Android Development](https://bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide-4th-edition/).  While I like likely fail to keep up this approach, I intend to have one commit per chapter.  Best of luck to me.

## App1 - Geo Quiz
A simple application that utilizes two activities and no external APIs to present the user with a series of basic geography questions (T/F).  It also includes `Cheat` functionality that keeps track of cheaters and tells them they suck.
